# react-component-store

React components are made for a hierarchical world. But every concern of a frontend application is not hierarchical for instance the data model for the application is often not hierarchical, more often its graphical with interdependencies between components. Thus as applications grow in size they have a state shared between unrelated components. Thus comes the challenge of application state management for frontend applications.

Flux is a pattern that significantly simplifies app state management, relay/OM is also another really nice approach which I would definitely prefer for bigger projects.

I had a couple of nice thoughts about application state management for my smaller projects:

1. Frontend application state management should be more simplified.
2. Store should belong to the component, I am not impressed by the idea of store away from components from which components get data.
3. Storing events rather than state is better way to manage state, using events we can derive state at any point.

Thus I wrote this small, simplified yet powerful library react-component-store and I use it in my React applications for state management. react-component-store derive its name from component-stores its is essentially a flavor of Flux.

## Features of react-component-store

1. Stores belongs to the components â˜º
2. The store for the component is an immutable map of key-value pairs.
3. Each component declare what all data it needs in its store.
4. Stores of all the components in the application can be updated using the method call `updateComponentStores(action, key, value)`. This can be called from any component and will update the store of all component which have declared to be using data with the given 'key'.
5. All the actions ever done are recorded sequentially.

## How react-component-store Works

react-component-store is a much simplified Library and its functioning can be explained as:

1. Components can declare to have its own store which is an immutable map. The store will be passed to the component in its props. They can access store like `props.store.get('data_key')`.
2. If there is an change in application state initiated in a component which is required to be know to an unrelated components in application the component can call the method of react-component-store library `updateComponentStores`, and it will update the stores of all the components which have declared to be using that data.
Method `updateComponentStores` supports following operations:
    1. NEW: `updateComponentStores('NEW', key, value)` will add `key->value` pairs to stores.
    2. DELETE: `updateComponentStores('DELETE', key)` will delete `key` from the stores.
    3. LIST_ADD: `updateComponentStores('LIST_ADD', key, value)` will add `value` to the list identified by `key` in the store. It will create the list if it does not already exists.
    4. LIST_REMOVE: `updateComponentStores('LIST_REMOVE', key, value)` will remove `value` from the list identified by `key` in the store.
    5. MAP_ADD: `updateComponentStores('MAP_ADD', key, value)` will add the pair `value.key->value.value` to the map identified by `key` in the store. It will create the map if it does not already exists.
    6. MAP_REMOVE: `updateComponentStores('MAP_REMOVE', key, value)` will remove the value identified by `value.key` from the map identified by `key` in the store.
    7. FLUSH: `updateComponentStores('FLUSH')` will reset the stores of all the components to original empty state.
3. It may happen that a component come into picture much later in the life cycle of the application, thus we need to be able to construct the store for that component. For this purpose react-component-store maintains the log of all the calls ever made to `updateComponentStores`. Thus the store for any component can be reconstructed at any point in time.

## Example
The library is extremely simplified and also easy for use.

### COMPONENT-1
It declares to have a store with data `data1` in it
```
import { configureStore } from 'react-component-store';
class Component1 extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.store.get('data1')}</div>
    );
  }
};
export default configureStore(['data1'])(Component1)
```
### COMPONENT-2
It calls `updateComponentStores` which will update store of component-1
```
import { updateComponentStores } from 'react-component-store';
export default class Component2 extends Component {
   setData1 = (event) => {
    updateComponentStores({ action: 'NEW', key: 'data1', value: event.target.value });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Enter some value for data1: <input onChange={ ::this.setData1 }/></div>
    );
  }
};
```
As the user enters some value in input box in Component-2 it will be reflected in Component-1.
